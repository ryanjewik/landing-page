                        I have created this webpage as part of the Odin Foundations Course I am taking online
                        to supplement my Computer Sciences Curriculum at Chapman University. Making this webpage
                        has been lots of fun, and I enjoy adding my own sense of personality to this page!
                        I hope you enjoy learning about me and what I like to do!
